Problem 37

The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible
to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each
stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797,
379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to
right and right to left.

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

[23, 37, 53, 73, 313, 317, 373, 797, 3137, 3797, 739397]
