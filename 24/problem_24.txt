Difficulty rating: 5%

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one
possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations
are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The
lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

012   021   102   120   201   210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8 and 9?

012
021
102
120
201
210
