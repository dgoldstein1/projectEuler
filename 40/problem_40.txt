Problem 40

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive
integers: $$0.12345678910{\color{red}\mathbf 1}112131415161718192021\cdots$$

It can be seen that the $12$^th digit of the fractional part is $1$.

If $d_n$ represents the $n$^th digit of the fractional part, find the value of
the following expression. $$d_1 \times d_{10} \times d_{100} \times d_{1000} \
times d_{10000} \times d_{100000} \times d_{1000000}$$
