Problem 31

In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There
are eight coins in general circulation:

    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

    1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
